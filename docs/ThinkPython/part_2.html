|                       | might have to run the |                       |
|                       | statements in another |                       |
|                       | function. Then, while |                       |
|                       | running that new      |                       |

|                       | Fortunately, Python   |                       |
|                       | is good at keeping    |                       |
|                       | track of where it is, |                       |
|                       | so each time a        |                       |
|                       | function completes,   |                       |
|                       | the program picks up  |                       |
|                       | where it left off in  |                       |
|                       | the function that     |                       |
|                       | called it. When it    |                       |
|                       | gets to the end of    |                       |
|                       | the program, it       |                       |
|                       | terminates.           |                       |

|                       | In summary, when you  |                       |
|                       | read a program, you   |                       |
|                       | don't always want to  |                       |
|                       | read from top to      |                       |
|                       | bottom. Sometimes it  |                       |
|                       | makes more sense if   |                       |
|                       | you follow the flow   |                       |

|                       | constant, which means |                       |
|                       | that for very big     |                       |

|                       | solution would be to  |                       |

|                       | process for writing   |                       |

|                       | steps of this process |                       |
|                       | are:                  |                       |

|                       | 1.  Start by writing  |                       |
|                       |     a small program   |                       |
|                       |     with no function  |                       |
|                       |     definitions.      |                       |
|                       | 2.  Once you get the  |                       |
|                       |     program working,  |                       |
|                       |     identify a        |                       |
|                       |     coherent piece of |                       |
|                       |     it, encapsulate   |                       |
|                       |     the piece in a    |                       |
|                       |     function and give |                       |
|                       |     it a name.        |                       |
|                       | 3.  Generalize the    |                       |
|                       |     function by       |                       |
|                       |     adding            |                       |
|                       |     appropriate       |                       |
|                       |     parameters.       |                       |
|                       | 4.  Repeat steps 1--3 |                       |
|                       |     until you have a  |                       |
|                       |     set of working    |                       |
|                       |     functions. Copy   |                       |
|                       |     and paste working |                       |
|                       |     code to avoid     |                       |
|                       |     retyping (and     |                       |
|                       |     re-debugging).    |                       |
|                       | 5.  Look for          |                       |
|                       |     opportunities to  |                       |
|                       |     improve the       |                       |

|                       |     refactoring. For  |                       |
|                       |     example, if you   |                       |
|                       |     have similar code |                       |
|                       |     in several        |                       |
|                       |     places, consider  |                       |
|                       |     factoring it into |                       |
|                       |     an appropriately  |                       |

|                       | This process has some |                       |
|                       | drawbacks---we will   |                       |

|                       | useful if you don't   |                       |
