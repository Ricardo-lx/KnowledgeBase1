|                       | function completes,   |                       |
|                       | the program picks up  |                       |

|                       | The first step is to  |                       |
|                       | consider what a       |                       |

|                       | function should look  |                       |
|                       | like in Python. In    |                       |
|                       | other words, what are |                       |
|                       | the inputs            |                       |
|                       | (parameters) and what |                       |
|                       | is the output (return |                       |
|                       | value)?               |                       |

|                       | In this case, the     |                       |
|                       | inputs are two        |                       |

|                       | numbers. The return   |                       |
|                       | value is the distance |                       |
|                       | represented by a      |                       |

|                       | 1.  Start with a      |                       |

|                       | is similar to a       |                       |
|                       | function---it takes   |                       |

|                       | This system works     |                       |
|                       | fine if the keys are  |                       |

|                       | keys are mutable,     |                       |

|                       | things happen. For    |                       |
|                       | example, when you     |                       |
|                       | create a key-value    |                       |
|                       | pair, Python hashes   |                       |
|                       | the key and stores it |                       |
|                       | in the corresponding  |                       |
|                       | location. If you      |                       |
|                       | modify the key and    |                       |
|                       | then hash it again,   |                       |
|                       | it would go to a      |                       |
|                       | different location.   |                       |
|                       | In that case you      |                       |
|                       | might have two        |                       |
|                       | entries for the same  |                       |
|                       | key, or you might not |                       |
|                       | be able to find a     |                       |
|                       | key. Either way, the  |                       |
|                       | dictionary wouldn't   |                       |
|                       | work correctly.       |                       |
|                       |                       |                       |
|                       | That's why keys have  |                       |
|                       | to be hashable, and   |                       |
|                       | why mutable types     |                       |
|                       | like lists aren't.    |                       |
|                       | The simplest way to   |                       |
|                       | get around this       |                       |
|                       | limitation is to use  |                       |
|                       | tuples, which we will |                       |

|                       | Since dictionaries    |                       |
|                       | are mutable, they     |                       |

|                       | bee", so the next     |                       |
|                       | suffix might be       |                       |

|                       | facilitate code       |                       |

|                       | the natural structure |                       |

|                       | suggestion: when you  |                       |
|                       | override a method,    |                       |
|                       | the interface of the  |                       |
|                       | new method should be  |                       |
|                       | the same as the old.  |                       |
|                       | It should take the    |                       |
|                       | same parameters,      |                       |
|                       | return the same type, |                       |
|                       | and obey the same     |                       |
|                       | preconditions and     |                       |
|                       | postconditions. If    |                       |
